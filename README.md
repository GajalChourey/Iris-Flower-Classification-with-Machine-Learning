This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained using the well-known Iris flower dataset from Scikit-learn.

Key functionalities:

Loads the Iris flower dataset from Scikit-learn.
Preprocesses the data (optional: handling missing values, scaling features).
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict flower species based on measurements.
Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy score.
Allows prediction of species for new flowers with unknown labels.
Files included:

iris_classification.py (or a preferred filename): Contains the Python code for data loading, preprocessing (if applicable), training, evaluation, and prediction.

Technologies used:

Python
Scikit-learn
How to use:

Install required libraries (scikit-learn, numpy etc.) using pip install.
Run the script: python iris_classification.py
(Optional) Modify the script to use a different classification algorithm or adjust hyperparameters.
Further exploration:

Experiment with different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines).
Implement more advanced data preprocessing techniques (e.g., feature scaling, dimensionality reduction).
Explore visualization techniques to understand the data and model behavior.
